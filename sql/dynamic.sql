Learn to eliminate tobacco cravings and urges with a variety of tools and support to help you succeed.</b>\r\n\r\nA Program for Smokers. Participants become ex-smokers in just <b>3 weeks.</b><p>\r\n\r\n<b>There''s no question about the benefits of stopping smoking, but it''s hard to stop by yourself.</b> There''s a good chance you''ve tried to quit before. However, when you thought about quitting you may have become uptight and anxious, and may have smoked even more.\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Until now, smoking has been one of the hardest addictions to end because it''s a complex psychological addiction.</b> It''s difficult to imagine what it''s like to live as a person who doesn''t smoke. To you, the thought of not smoking means giving up an old friend, being deprived of something really important. The truth is, a person who has never smoked doesn''t miss it, and you won''t either after the LivingFree™ Program. We use a patented process called structured cognitive training that will enable you to permanently change your relationship with cigarettes and smoking.\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>    How LivingFree Works</h3>\r\n\r\n<b>Our philosophy at LivingFree™ is if people can change the way they think, they can change their lives in any way they desire.</b> You will discover new ways of thinking about the process of stopping smoking, ways that are very different than any program you''ve tried before.\r\n<p>\r\n<b>You will discover and understand the many ways your mind tricks you and affects you emotionally and physically, and how it gets you to keep on smoking.</b> In a few short days you''ll learn how to master your mind and change your emotional relationship with cigarettes, and actually turn quitting into a positive experience. You''ll learn how to eliminate the psychological blocks and how to draw from your own natural abilities to counter them easily. In just a few short days, you will learn to stop smoking:\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>with pride and dignity (no tricks or gimmicks)\r\n    <li>without gaining weight\r\n    <li>without feeling irritable, frustrated or anxious\r\n    <li>without feeling deprived and missing your cigarettes\r\n<b>You''ll learn how to deal effectively with stress, boredom, and other problems without cigarettes. We''re so confident that this program will work for you that it''s fully guaranteed.</b> Take the first five sessions, and if you''re not completely satisfied, you may have your tuition refunded in full.\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>Program Schedule</h3>\r\n<p>\r\nLivingFree™ consists of 12 sessions over 21 days. Attending each session is important as it''s a step-by-step process where one day builds the foundation for the next. The first five sessions are on consecutive days.\r\n<p>\r\nEach session consists of an audio/visual seminar and interactive quizzes, lasting from 30 - 45 minutes. There are also many support components like Real Talk, a live internet radio show where you may call in and talk to a medical professional and get advice.\r\n<p>\r\nYou quit, believe it or not, after Session 3.

However, too much stress can actually harm your mind and body over time. Persistent and unrelenting stress often leads to anxiety, depression, and unhealthy behaviors such as overeating and drug or alcohol abuse.\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>How LivingEasy Works</h3>\r\n\r\n<b>Become a self-leader</b><br>\r\nHow do you respond to disruptions in your life? Do you fight back or resign yourself to permanent suffering? Are you living the life you want or the one that is being dealt to you on a daily basis by others? You can experience the joy and satisfaction that we all deserve by taking this powerful workshop delivered by Dr. Mary Steinhardt. She will teach you how you can transform the events and relationships that NOW cause you the most distress into events and relationships that bring you power, freedom, and control.\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Transform your stressful relationships</b>\r\nYou have heard before that it''s not the events in life that cause our happiness but rather the way that we respond to the events that take place. While other programs and products generally provide short-term, band-aid solutions, LivingEasy™ treats the root emotional causes of the drama, trauma, and distress you may experience. This method, called Structural Cognitive Training, teaches you how to experience the disruptions that overwhelm us emotionally into events that help us thrive and become more powerful individuals.\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>Join others from around the world and enroll now</b><br>\r\nAt Mary''s online group workshop you will take the LivingEasy™ Resilience and Stress Management Program with people from around the globe.

Mary''s online workshops are similar to the live programs she teaches nationwide, and you can attend them in the privacy of your own home. All you need is a PC with speakers and Flash - which most computers have.\r\n<p>\r\n<h3>What you''ll get:</h3>\r\n\r\n<b>The Classes</b><br>\r\nLivingEasy™ Resilience and Stress Management consists of four classes taught by Dr. Steinhardt. There is no set schedule although we recommend that you attend a session every other day. You may take the sessions at any time during the day or night. If you miss a class you can always take it when you have time by clicking on the start session button on your Personal Home Page. She teaches the program in an audio/visual workshop format utilizing Flash animation, quizzes, and a printable Online Manual which reinforces the critical concepts of the program. Each Class is 30 – 40 minutes in length and is divided into segments. After each segment the system will bookmark it for you so if you run out of time you may come back later or the next day and pick up where you left off.\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>RealTalkRadio™</b><br>\r\nLog on to live internet radio chats with SelfHelpWorks'' founder, Lou Ryan, and other experts.

The thought of not drinking can be perceived as giving up an old friend or of being deprived of something really important. For many of us alcohol is connected to many parts of our lives like happy hour, winding down, dinner, parties, sporting events, and so on. The thought of not drinking in those situations or drinking less can be hard to imagine.\r\n<p>\r\n    <b>The truth is,</b> a person who has never started drinking doesn''t miss it, and you won''t either after the LivingSmart™ Program.

It empowers participants to make rational rather than emotional decisions about what, where, when and how much to drink.

Attending each of the first five sessions is important, as it''s a step-by-step process where one day builds the foundation for the next. The first five sessions are on consecutive days. We purposely set it up this way in order to help you create momentum. The program is delivered entirely by a certified instructor, online. He will teach you how to take charge of your life and relationship with alcohol through engaging and empowering stories, examples, and highly interactive feedback. Learn how to become an ex-drinker without feeling deprived and without missing it. Become excited and enthusiastic about the possibilities for your future by just listening to powerful life-changing principles and practicing the simple concepts that you are taught in the workshop.\r\n\r\n<b>Here''s the way it works:</b> You take the introduction and then choose a quit day. It can be as much as three months out. You decide when you think you''re going to be ready. You only need one button to use the course. Everything else - your schedule, your e-mails, and the feedback - are automated and simple to use. The program is customized to you. It guides, reinforces, and even cajoles you.
